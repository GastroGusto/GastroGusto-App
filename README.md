# GastroGusto
## Brought to you by Pedro Paulos and Emily Stevenson

This our second Ironhack project, an app that allows you to review your favourite Michelin Star Restaurants. We have access to a *HUGE* database for all current restaurants included in the Michelin Guide.

### **Basic Instructions**

Use the search bar to search by the name of the Restaurant or use our handy links to see a pre-selected list. You can create reviews and set your rating to:
- No Award
- Bib Gourmand
- 1 Michelin Star
- 2 Michelin Stars
- 3 Michelin Stars

You can also edit and delete your own reviews. 

We wonder if you will agree with the Michelin Guide...do these restaurants deserve your stars?
